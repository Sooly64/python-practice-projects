# 🧮 Simple Command-Line Calculator

A beginner-friendly Python calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations from the command line with clean UX, error handling, and replay functionality.

## 🚀 Features

- Performs operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**` (power), `%` (modulo)  
- Handles division by zero gracefully  
- Clean input validation for numbers and operations  
- Customizable user experience with clear prompts and messages  
- Repeats calculations until user exits  
- Smooth exit animation using `time.sleep()`
- History storage and animated display

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Input validation using `try`/`except`  
- Custom error handling with `ZeroDivisionError` and `ValueError`  
- Functions and modular coding practices  
- UX‑focused message constants  
- Python control flow: loops and conditionals

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3

## 📦 How to Run

1. Clone the repository or copy the code into a file named `calculator.py`.  
2. In your terminal, navigate to the project directory.  
3. Run the calculator with:  
   
       python calculator.py  
   
4. Follow the on‑screen prompts to perform calculations.

## 📝 Example Usage

```text
Enter Your First Number: 5  
Enter Your Second Number: 3  
Enter an Operation (*, /, -, +, **, %): **  
Your Answer is: 125.0  
Do you want to calculate again? y/n: y  
...
```

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Add support for more operations (e.g., square root, logarithms)  
- Create a GUI version with Tkinter or PyQt  
- Save calculation history to a file  
- Add support for keyboard shortcuts
